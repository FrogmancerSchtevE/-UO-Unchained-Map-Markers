## [2025-08-04] – Overhaul & Optimization Update

### Added
-  NPC location markers added across various overworld regions to assist with player navigation.
-  Deceit dungeon region markers implemented to enhance dungeon pathing and exploration.

### Changed
-  Inactive overworld moongate markers removed to reduce visual clutter and reflect current shard state.
-  Adjusted positioning of several map icons for better alignment with actual in-game POIs.
-  Moved select quest-related POIs into `quests.xml` for improved in-game filtering and searchability.
-  Updated icon type from `landmark` to `pin` for quest-related entries, making them more distinguishable.

### Removed
